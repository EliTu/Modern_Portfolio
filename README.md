# Building a Modern Portfolio Website - By Traversy Media

## Introduction

This is my personal repo for the [Traversy Media](http://www.traversymedia.com/) "Responsive Portfolio Website" tutorial series, that will contain the final product, the code involved and a detailed documentation of the production proccess.

In this project we will be building a responsive portfolio website from the ground up. We will be using HTML5, CSS3, SASS and some JavaScript to make a fully functional, interactive and modern looking personal portfolio website.

## The documentation

All of the documentation and the code included are written in detail by me, and they tightly follow the style and methods presented by Brad in his video series.

The documentation are divided into 7 parts, each part covers different aspect in the production of the website, from the markup pages, the styles, setting up SASS, JavaScript code and more.

The purpose of the documentation is to have the ability reach a detailed reference in the future, to better facilitate the knowledge gained in the tutorial and to present a detailed account of the process of building a modern website, using modern tools and technologies. Also, I would like to present a demonstration of my learning process and the ability to produce documentations, for those who have the relevant interest.
